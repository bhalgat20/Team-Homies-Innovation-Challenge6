# ONDC Invovation Hackathon  

### Problem Statement :
    Create a model (using formal programming language) for non-deterministic inventory
    management to determine the optimal “lot size” to minimize the operational costs related to
    ordering and moving goods through the retail supply chain.

### Solution :

#### Description :

  A non-deterministic ML model which predicts optimal qantinty of products for a seller . 
 
    key-Hightlights:
      1. Customised prediction for each seller on platform 
      2. Ability to extract required feature i.g : 
      3. Auto-retrain mechanism  over a period of time with live data
      4.
      
Adavantages : 
      1. 
      2.
    
#### Techincal Detail : 
    API :
    
    
#### Assumptions :
  1. Lot size of every products is 100 
  2. 


### Project Setup : 

       
### Future Scope :
